/**
 * THE FOUR STATES OF ASKING A SERVER TO DO SOMETHING: idle, busy, done, refused.
 *
 * Two controls in the bump page's corner had this written out longhand, and they got it subtly
 * differently in three places, all of which are the refusal handling:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>What counts as a refusal. One read a boolean off the answer; the other compared the state
 *       the server read back against the state that was asked for. Both are right for their own
 *       endpoint, which is why `read` is the caller's and everything else is not.</li>
 *   <li>What is cleared when a new ask starts. Both cleared the refusal, and they had to: a control
 *       still wearing the last refusal while a fresh ask is in flight is lying about the present.
 *       Only one of them cleared its "it worked" flag as well, and the other could briefly show
 *       done and busy at once.</li>
 *   <li>What a thrown request says. Both prefixed it, by hand, with the same sentence, which is
 *       to say the sentence was one edit away from being two sentences.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS DISABLED. That belongs to the control: `aria-disabled` rather than the attribute,
 * because the real one drops a button out of the tab order mid-action and strands a keyboard user
 * on the document body. This hook only says whether an ask is in flight; both controls check it
 * before calling `ask` again, and a second call while busy is the caller's to refuse.
